### UX wishlist

- linking between pages
- use context instead of local & session storage
- change password
- complete CRUD

### UI wishlist

- burger nav
- darkmode
- pixelate avatar if anonymous (attempted, but unsuccessful)

### Lessons Learned:

- start with imports first (eg Tailwind), then style.
- start with CRUD first as it's crucial for blueprint
- use Context where possible - works together with CRUD
- limit props passing down through children
- watch out for unsupported packages
